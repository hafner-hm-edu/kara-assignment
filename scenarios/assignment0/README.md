Example scenario
================
 
This example scenario shows the basic concepts of this project. It could be safely deleted if 
you are deploying your own assignment scenarios.

A scenario contains the whole source code of GreenfootKara 2.1.1 from [Marco Jakob](http://code.makery.ch)
as well as an empty assignment class [Assignment0](Assignment0.java) and
its associated unit test class
[Assignment0Test](../../src/test/java/Assignment0Test.java). 

Goal of this example assignment is to create a program that draws a diamond 
into an empty arbitrary sized world. (This example starts with an empty world. Have a look at the various
verifyWorld methods in [AbstractKaraTest](../../src/main/java/AbstractKaraTest.java) to see on how to start with 
an existing world).
