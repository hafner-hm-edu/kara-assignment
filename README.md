Testing GreenfootKara Programs
==============================

[GreenfootKara](http://code.makery.ch/library/greenfoot-kara/) programs are only runnable using the integrated 
development environment [Greenfoot](www.greenfoot.org/) with manual interaction. **KaraTest** adds a unit test feature 
for GreenfootKara programs. Using this extension, you can create simple [JUnit](http://junit.org/) tests to validate
existing GreenfootKara programs. You can start these unit tests either in an arbitrary development environment 
(e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, ...) or in a terminal using the build management tool [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). 
All you need is to deploy your scenarios and tests into the proposed folders of this project. 
Greenfoot is **not** required to start and evaluate these tests: all dependencies to Greenfoot are replaced with a 
mock that is intercepting calls to Greenfoot.

Additionally, static code analysis has been configured so that the code could be checked for common bug patterns 
(FindBugs), for coding style violations (CheckStyle), and for conformance to best practices (PMD). 
The configuration of these tools is derived from [my Java coding style](https://github.com/uhafner/codingstyle) 
(currently available in German only).

This project has been used in my lecture **Software development with Java** to automatically evaluate the solutions of 
weekly assignments. Because of this I applied several naming conventions to simplify the processing. These naming 
conventions are not required to use **KaraTest** as a library, so feel free to change these values if required.


This project requires installation of [JDK 8](http://www.java.com) und [Maven 3.x](http://maven.apache.org/).


## Creating the tests 

The tests of a scenario use the typical [JUnit](http://junit.org/) naming conventions and are named 
Assignment1Test.java, Assignment2Test.java, etc. For each assignment multiple tests could be specified
using a `public void` method with an `@Test` annotation. In order to get these tests automatically evaluated, they 
must follow the Maven conventions and must be copied to the folder [src/test/java](../master/src/test/java). Tests 
(as well as the actual assignments) are located in the default package. The tests are not part of a scenario folder.
 
## Example scenario
 
An example is available that shows the basic concepts of this project: [assignment0](../master/scenarios/assignment0). 
Here you can see how to structure the scenarios. A unit test is available as well:
[Assignment0Test](../master/src/test/java/Assignment0Test.java). 
In this assignment, a world containing a diamond needs to be created. The provided unit test checks the program
by inspecting the created world after the program. (All examples start with an empty world. Have a look at the various
verifyWorld methods in [AbstractKaraTest](../master/src/main/java/AbstractKaraTest.java) to see on how to start with 
an existing world). Note that the unit tests will fail after a given timeout has been exceeded. So the evaluation will 
not hang due to broken solutions. 
 
## Running the tests 

You can start the tests for all scenarios in a terminal using the following command:

```
  mvn clean test
```

## Running the static analysis

You can generate various project reports in a terminal using the following command:
 
```
  mvn clean test -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true site
```

You can visit the generated reports in the browser afterwards: just navigate to the index file in the output folder 
`target/site/index.html`. 

## Note

In order to validate only classes of the actual assignments, the files Assignment1.java, Assignment2.java, etc. 
are copied from the folder `scenarios` to the folder `target/copied-assignments` during execution of Maven. 
I.e. in folder `target/copied-assignments` only the actual assignment classes are visible, the dependencies 
are not available here. Do not edit these files, since they will be overridden during the next run of Maven. 
Also, if you open a scenario in the folder `scenarios` with Greenfoot then the containing files are automatically 
updated by Greenfoot, i.e. these files might be not in sync anymore with the files in 
folder `target/copied-assignments`!
